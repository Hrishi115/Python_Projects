🐍 Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my repository of Python projects! 🎉
This repo is a growing collection of mini-projects, experiments, and practice scripts I’ve built while learning and exploring Python.

Each folder contains a separate project with its own code and (sometimes) additional documentation or screenshots.

🌱 Why this repo?

I wanted to go beyond just generic Python tutorials and start building real, hands-on projects.
This repo is a log of my journey — experimenting, debugging, and improving with each project.

📌 Notes

* Every project here is built from scratch by me.
* Some projects may evolve with new features over time.
* Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
